        <p>
          According to
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js">wikipedia</a> Node.js
          was written initially by Ryan Dahl in 2009, about thirteen years after
          the introduction of the first server-side JavaScript environment,
          Netscape's LiveWire Pro Web. The initial release supported only Linux
          and Mac OS X. Its development and maintenance was led by Dahl and
          later sponsored by Joyent. Dahl criticized the limited possibilities
          of the most popular web server in 2009, Apache HTTP Server, to handle
          a lot of concurrent connections (up to 10,000 and more) and the most
          common way of creating code (sequential programming), when code either
          blocked the entire process or implied multiple execution stacks in the
          case of simultaneous connections. Dahl demonstrated the project at the
          inaugural European JSConf on November 8, 2009. Node.js combined
          Google's V8 JavaScript engine, an event loop, and a low-level I/O API.

        <p>
          Node.js has proved itself useful for developing applications that make
          use of the ability to run JavaScript both on the client as well as on
          the server side. According to a survey made by the Node.js Foundation,
          whose mission is to enable widespread adoption and help accelerate the
          development of Node.js, web applications are the top use case, with a
          share of 85%. But as the examples below illustrate, they are not the
          only one.

        <header>Node.js Vs PHP</header>
        <p>
          PHP and Node.js are two of the major backend technologies that power
          web applications. PHP is older between the two, so it naturally has a
          larger community and major projects in its kitty. That said, the PHP
          community has started realizing a lack of relevant and updated
          projects. Surprisingly, this is exactly where Node.js is most
          successful- building a strong user base across projects meant for
          modern-day use cases.
        </p>

        <p>
          PHP is among the most reliable server-side scripting languages in the
          employ of giants like Facebook, Wikipedia, and Tumblr. This language
          has been around since 1995 and continually benefits from a large
          community that’s sprouted around it.
          <a href="https://www.simform.com/blog/nodejs-vs-php/">[learn more]</a>
        </p>

        <p>
          Although it’s synchronous and works well only with a central server in
          place, it has several built-in functions and libraries that make
          building e-commerce and CMS websites super easy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Launched in 2009, Node.js has quickly established its dominance in key
          web-application categories. Used by LinkedIn, Netflix, Medium, and
          other big players, its popular asynchronous architecture gives it the
          efficiency and speed crucial for the handling of queries.
        </p>

        <p>
          While PHP is a scripting language and Node.js is a runtime
          environment, both are widely used as backend technologies for web-app
          development. With the help of libraries, frameworks, and APIs, both
          Node.js and PHP prove ideal for an array of projects.

        <header>How to install Node.js</header>

        <p>
          According to the website <a>nodejs.dev</a> Node.js can be installed in
          different ways. They highlights the most common and convenient ones.
          Official packages for all the major platforms are available at
          <a href="https://nodejs.dev/download/">https://nodejs.dev/download/</a
          >.<br />
          One very convenient way to install Node.js is through a package
          manager. In this case, every operating system has its own. Other
          package managers for MacOS, Linux, and Windows are listed in
          <a
            href="https://nodejs.dev/download/package-manager/
          "
            >https://nodejs.dev/download/package-manager/.</a
          ><br /><br />
          <code>nvm</code> is a popular way to run Node.js. It allows you to
          easily switch the Node.js version, and install new versions to try and
          easily rollback if something breaks, for example. It is also very
          useful to test your code with old Node.js versions.<br />
          See
          <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm "
            >https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
          </a>
          for more information about this option. In any case, when Node.js is
          installed you'll have access to the node executable program in the
          command line.
